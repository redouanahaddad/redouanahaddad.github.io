# Pro File Astro

Pro File is a website template for a portfolio website that is centered around beautiful imagery. Some of the features include:

- A dynamic photo grid on the home page for different sizes of images
- A contact page with a contact form
- An about page for the owner/creator
- Individual pages for each piece of work. (case studies, photo journal entries, blog posts)
- Fast performance
- Custom fonts
- Responsive Design (mobile, tablet, desktop)

## Get Started 

General familiarity with Astro and its conventions is expected with this template but the code should be organized in a way for any web developer familiar with Node-based projects to understand.

### Installation

Open the unzipped files in your favorite code editor and run the following command to install and run it locally.

```sh
npm i && npm start
```

### Customizing The Theme

Customize the global site settings such as the title and description in the `src/data/settings.ts` file. You can also disable the Little Sticks plug from there by setting `showLittleSticksPlug` to `false`.

### Adding Your Own Content

Write your own works in markdown and the template will update automatically. You can add your own images to the `public/assets/images/work` folder.
